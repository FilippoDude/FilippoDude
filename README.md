# Hi 👋, I'm Filippo 

I'm a software developer based in Italy that likes to always try out new things and ideas.

## 👨‍💻 Languages I work mostly with:
- **Typescript** (Mostly)
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **REACT** (also NextJS)
- **JAVA**
- **KOTLIN** (only for android app development)
- **FLUTTER** (mobile)

## Projects I'm most proud of:
- Widgets Crate | A mobile app for android made with Flutter and native Kotlin code that allows you to add cool and unique widgets.
- My portfolio website | While not being a service or tool, i'm still pretty proud of it

I also do 3D modelling in Blender (see on socials)

Of course i have smaller projects in other pages... *just check my repositories and find out!*
